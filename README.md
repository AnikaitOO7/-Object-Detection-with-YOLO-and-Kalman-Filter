# Object Detection with YOLO and Kalman Filter

This project demonstrates real-time object detection using the YOLO model, along with Kalman filtering to smooth the detection's crosshair. The application is implemented using Python, OpenCV, Tkinter, and Supervision.

## Features

- Real-time object detection using YOLOv8
- Smoothing of detected objects' crosshair using Kalman Filter
- Visual representation of both raw and filtered detections
- Tkinter-based GUI for displaying the video feed

## Installation

### Prerequisites
